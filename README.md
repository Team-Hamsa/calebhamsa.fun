# calebhamsa.fun

Caleb's blocky corner of the internet: 🎵 **Note Blocks** (notes, chords,
scales and an ear-training game), 🎨 **Draw**, and ✍️ **Write** (print and
cursive tracing).

It's built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no frameworks, no build
step), so every file can be opened, read, changed and tried.

## Run it on your computer

The pages use JavaScript "modules", which browsers only load from a web
server (not by double-clicking the file). Python has a tiny one built in:

```bash
cd caleb-website
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000>. Change a file, save, and reload the page.

## What's where

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The homepage: title, three big blocks, favorite things |
| `music.html` | The Note Blocks page layout |
| `draw.html` | The Draw & Trace page layout |
| `css/blocks.css` | How everything **looks**: colors, block buttons, animations |
| `js/music-theory.js` | The music brain: notes as numbers, chords, scales (pure math) |
| `js/music.js` | Makes Note Blocks work: sound, modes, record, Guess it! |
| `js/draw.js` | The drawing pad: brushes, colors, clear, save |
| `js/trace.js` | Handwriting sheets: lines, print/cursive letters, fade-out rows |
| `js/ui.js` | Two little helpers every page shares |
| `tests/` | Automatic checks: run `npm test` (needs Node 20+, nothing to install) |

Every file starts with a comment explaining what it does, and every
function has a comment saying what goes in and what comes out.

## 🧪 Experiments to try

Search the code for `🧪 Try this!` to find them all. Some favorites:

1. **Night sky:** in `css/blocks.css`, change `--sky` to `#1a1a40`.
2. **Old-time tuning:** in `js/music-theory.js`, change `A4_HZ` from 440 to 415.
3. **Long notes:** in `js/music.js`, set `NOTE_SECONDS` to 3.
4. **Hear the click:** set `ATTACK_SECONDS` to 0, then tap a block.
5. **A new chord:** add `sus4: [0, 5, 7],` to `CHORDS`, then copy a chord button in `music.html` and change it to `data-chord="sus4"`.
6. **A new scale:** add `blues: [3, 2, 1, 1, 3, 2],` to `SCALES`, plus a button.
7. **Wild rainbow:** in `js/draw.js`, set `RAINBOW_STEP` to 30.
8. **Hot pink:** add `'#ff69b4'` to `COLORS`.
9. **Four fading copies:** in `js/trace.js`, set `FADE_OPACITIES` to `[0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1]`.
10. **New favorite thing:** add an `<li>` to the list in `index.html`.

## Checklist for a real tablet or phone

Run through this after big changes (Caleb is the best tester):

- [ ] Every homepage block opens its page, and 🏠 comes back.
- [ ] Music: the first tap makes sound. On iPhone/iPad, also check the silent switch is off: it mutes web audio.
- [ ] Music: holding a computer key plays one note, not a stream.
- [ ] Music: chords light all their blocks; scales glow and dim; Guess it! counts a right note even after changing octave.
- [ ] Draw: drawing doesn't scroll the page; two fingers draw two separate lines.
- [ ] Draw: a quick tap on 🗑 does nothing; holding it for 1 second clears.
- [ ] Draw: 💾 downloads a PNG.
- [ ] Trace: the cursive guide is joined-up cursive (not a plain font).
- [ ] Trace: weird text in "your word" (emoji, numbers) is cleaned up.
- [ ] Rotating the tablet keeps the drawing and redraws the guides.
- [ ] Nothing scrolls sideways on a phone.

## Publishing

The site is hosted by GitHub Pages from the `main` branch of
`Team-Hamsa/calebhamsa.fun`. Pushing to `main` updates the live site in
about a minute. There's no build step: GitHub serves these exact files.
